TODO SO I WON'T FORGET TOMORROW LOL

- Make it work so you don't have to click on equal
- Make it so you can only click the adding,subscracting,etc buttons once before adding another number allowing you to use it once again
- Fix the result box so the result doesn't go out of it
- Delete history after the user got their result and tries another something
- Add keyboard functionality
- Potentially add more CSS / change the UI's color.
